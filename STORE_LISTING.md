## App Review Notes (for Apple)

"Window Seat AI uses flight data from AeroAPI to provide real-time route information. Users enter a flight number, and the app generates AI narrations about landmarks along the route. All content can be downloaded for offline use during flight mode. The app requires an internet connection only for initial flight pack download."
