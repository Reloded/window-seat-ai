# Privacy Policy for Window Seat AI

**Last Updated:** January 25, 2026

## Overview

Window Seat AI ("the App") is a flight companion app that provides narrated information about landmarks and terrain during your flight. Your privacy is important to us.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
- The App uses your device's GPS to track your position during flights
- Location data is processed **entirely on your device** and is **not transmitted to our servers**
- Location tracking only occurs when you actively use the App during a flight

### Flight Information
- Flight numbers you enter to download narration packs
- This information is used solely to fetch route data and is not stored on our servers

### Locally Stored Data
The following data is stored **only on your device**:
- Downloaded narration audio files
- Cached map tiles for offline use
- Flight history and favorites
- Your app settings and preferences

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** collect personal identification information
- We do **not** track your flights or travel history on our servers
- We do **not** sell or share any data with third parties
- We do **not** use analytics or tracking SDKs

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party APIs to generate content:

| FlightAware AeroAPI | Flight route data | Flight number only |
| OpenStreetMap | Landmark identification | Geographic coordinates |
| Anthropic Claude | Narration text generation | Geographic coordinates, landmark names |

All third-party API calls occur **only during the download phase** before your flight, while you have internet connectivity. During the flight itself, the App works entirely offline.

## Data Storage

All downloaded content (narrations, audio, map tiles) is stored locally on your device. You can delete this data at any time through the App's settings or by uninstalling the App.
